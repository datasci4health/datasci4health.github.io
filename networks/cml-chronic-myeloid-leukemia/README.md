# Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)

Each folder prefixed with `article-` corresponds to a study based on a scientific article. The `kegg`and `wikipathways` folders contain data concerning CML data in these data sources.

Most of the article folders are preliminary. The only two developed and adopted in classes are:

* `article-imatinib` - related to `2024-04-18 Gene Expression and Networks`
* `article-progression` related to `2024-04-25 Gene Expression, Networks, and Knowledge Graphs`
